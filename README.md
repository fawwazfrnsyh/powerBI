Based on customer demography, please define a strategy based on data to improve coffee shop's revenue

- Target promotions towards females: Since females make more transactions than males, it may be beneficial to tailor promotional offers towards them. For example, offering discounts or loyalty programs geared towards women may encourage more frequent visits and larger purchases.
- Develop marketing campaigns to attract older customers: As the age group above 50 makes the highest number of transactions, creating marketing campaigns that appeal to this demographic could be a valuable strategy. This could involve offering promotions during specific times of day or creating a special menu geared towards older customers.
